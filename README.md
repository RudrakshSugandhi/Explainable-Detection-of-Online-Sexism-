# Explainable-Detection-of-Online-Sexism-

* In the current digital era, when online platforms have developed into a fertile ground for sex-ist conduct, the identification of online sexism is an essential responsibility.
* Traditional machine learning techniques are unable to offer an explanation for the sexism that is observed, which might impede the creation of efficient mitigation solutions.
* This project suggests an explainable detection strategy for online sexism that combines cutting-edge explainable models with established machine earning techniques.
* The system is able to spot instances of sexism in online material while giving justification for its choices, improving the processâ€™s transparency and interpret ability.
