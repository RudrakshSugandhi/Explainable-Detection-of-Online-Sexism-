# Explainable-Detection-of-Online-Sexism-

In the current digital era, when online platforms
have developed into a fertile ground for sex-
ist conduct, the identification of online sexism
is an essential responsibility. Traditional ma-
chine learning techniques, however, frequently
are unable to offer an explanation for the sex-
ism that is observed, which might impede the
creation of efficient mitigation solutions. This
study suggests an explainable detection strategy
for online sexism that combines cutting-edge
explainable models with established machine
learning techniques. The system is able to spot
instances of sexism in online material while
giving justification for its choices, improving
the processâ€™s transparency and interpret ability.
